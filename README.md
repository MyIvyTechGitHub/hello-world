M06 ASSIGNMENT PART I 
This is the first step of my assignment, to create a repository.
I am working on the Make and commit changes part of this guide and now I have more text added to my readme file.
I added a Pull Request and I am learning how to Open a Pull Request and make a new request to compare the text of this readme with the readme 
of the main branch of my repository.
